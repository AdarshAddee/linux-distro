# linux-distro
linux-distro is a free tool which helps us to install the minimal versions of linux-distroes with the help of pre-built existing packages named proot-distro. There are 7 linux-distroes with minimal versions. you can install it and use it with root access. I don't know why but only ubuntu works perfectly. I recommend you guys to install ubuntu in your termux.
